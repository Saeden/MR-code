SET UP:

Due to the open3d library, the project should run with Python 3.6, 3.7 or 3.8. Latest / older versions would result in an installation error.

1) Download the zip file of the project
2) Open the whole folder (MR-code) in an editor (we coded in PyCharm, so the best option would be to open it in PyCharm)
3) Create a new empty interpreter for the project (in PyCharm: go to preferences -> project interpreter -> create a new one)
4) Run the following command in the command line (be sure to be in the same folder of the project): 
   - Unix/macOS: python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
   - Windows: py -m pip install -r requirements.txt
   
   If for some reasons that doesn't work, manually install all these libraries:
   - annoy==1.17.0
   - colorcet==2.0.6
   - matplotlib==3.4.3
   - mplcursors==0.5
   - numpy==1.21.2
   - open3d==0.13.0
   - pandas==1.3.3
   - pyglet==1.5.21
   - scikit-learn==0.24.2
   - scipy==1.7.1
   - seaborn==0.11.2
   - setuptools==58.1.0
   - trimesh==3.9.30

5) Run main.py
